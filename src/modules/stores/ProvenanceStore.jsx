/* Brief overview of Trrack logic and the actions it performs on provenance data
*
* Trrack Syntax is:
* createAction( (<state>, <payload>) => { ... } )
*   createAction(...) is the syntax that buiilds and returns the action creator.
*       setOntologyAction, setSigThresholdAction, setFilterCutoffAction and the like are action creators.
*   <state> is the first parameter and _always_ equals Trrack's currently tracked state.
*   <payload> can be a single plain value or a tuple/triplet/... of dependent values, like {ontology, cutoff} or {ontology, selectionLocked, selectedConditions}
*   => { ... } describes the reducer function which contains the actual function logic.
*   
*   When ProvenanceStore.jsx is first executed, createAction(...) runs once for each of our tracked actions,
*       thereby building an action creator (like setOntologyAction) for each of our tracked actions.
*   These action creators then get called later, wherever the corresponding change actually happens
*       e.g. RootStore.setOntology(...) calls setOntologyAction(ontology) whenever the user changes the ontology in the top right corner
*   Calling an action creator does not automatically run the corresponding reducer function contained within the action creator.
*   Only when we later perform an action that involves provenance.apply(<event>, <label>), Trrack looks up the respective reducer function,
*       checks the current provenance state and calls said reducer on (<currentState>, <payload>).
*   This is the core logic that builds up our provenance graph.
*   
*   If we perform a forward action, meaning: an action that adds a child to our provenance graph,
*       we directly execute the action and Trrack logs it for us via the provenance graph.
*   If we perform a backward action (like undo/redo), Trrack fetches the result and hands it back to us via callback logic.
